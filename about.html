      <h1>About TestDNA.bio</h1>
      <p>
        TestDNA.bio is a small, independent information site that helps people understand
        <strong>DNA testing</strong> before they buy an at-home kit. The goal is simple:
        cut through marketing language and give you clear, realistic expectations of what a DNA test
        can and cannot do.
      </p>

      <h2>Who is behind the site?</h2>
      <p>
        TestDNA.bio is operated by <strong>ronarn</strong> (Norway). The same owner runs
        <a href="https://genectics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Genectics.com</a>, an
        independent hub for DNA test reviews and comparisons.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rather than building one large, cluttered website, the idea is to use focused, descriptive
        domains like <strong>TestDNA.bio</strong> and <strong>DNAKit.bio</strong> for clear,
        topic-specific pages that send visitors to the main comparison engine on Genectics.com.
      </p>

      <h2>What TestDNA.bio does (and does not) do</h2>
      <div class="grid grid-2">
        <div class="card-ghost">
          <h3>What we do</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Explain how DNA testing works in simple language.</li>
            <li>Outline differences between ancestry, health and mixed DNA tests.</li>
            <li>Highlight key questions to ask about accuracy and privacy.</li>
            <li>Link to deeper comparisons and reviews on Genectics.com.</li>
          </ul>

        <div class="card-ghost">
          <h3>What we don&#39;t do</h3>

            <li>Sell DNA kits directly on TestDNA.bio.</li>
            <li>Offer medical or legal advice.</li>

      <h2>Relationship with Genectics.com</h2>
      <p>
        Most links on TestDNA.bio point to <strong>Genectics.com</strong>, which is built as a
        neutral comparison hub for DNA tests. On Genectics.com you&#39;ll find:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Side-by-side comparisons of major DNA test providers.</li>
        <li>Notes on accuracy, privacy policies and region coverage.</li>
        <li>Where relevant, affiliate links to some providers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you choose to buy a kit after clicking a link on Genectics.com, the site may receive an
        affiliate commission from the provider&mdash;at no extra cost to you. This helps keep the
        content online and up to date.
      </p>

      <h2>Why use .bio domains for DNA testing?</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>.bio</strong> extension is a natural fit for biology, genetics and health topics.
        Domains like <strong>TestDNA.bio</strong>, <strong>DNAKit.bio</strong> and
        <strong>Retinol.bio</strong> are designed to be:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Memorable and self-explanatory.</li>
        <li>Easy to understand for non-technical visitors.</li>
        <li>Good entry points into deeper, more detailed resources.</li>
      </ul>

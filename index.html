      <h2>DNA Test 101 – What a DNA Test Actually Measures</h2>
      <p>
        Consumer DNA tests analyze hundreds of thousands of SNPs (genetic markers) to estimate
        where your ancestors may have lived and identify relatives who share segments of DNA.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most ancestry tests are built on statistical models, large reference datasets, and how
        your DNA compares to anonymized population samples. These models improve over time but
        still have limits.

        Modern at-home DNA tests generally fall into three categories:
      </p>

      <div class="grid grid-3">
        <div class="mini-card">
          <h3>Ancestry Tests</h3>
          <p>
            Focus on ethnicity estimates and relative matching. Best for genealogy and family
            discoveries.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="mini-card">
          <h3>Health DNA Tests</h3>
          <p>
            Include selected genetic traits, carrier status, or risk markers depending on
            regulatory approval in your region.

        </div>
        <div class="mini-card">
          <h3>Combined Tests</h3>
          <p>
            Offer both ancestry and health in one kit. Popular for people who want a broader

    <!-- LIVINGDNA SPECIALIST + RECOMMENDED KITS -->
    <section id="livingdna" class="card">
      <h2>Where LivingDNA Fits In</h2>
      <p>
        Most of the well-known DNA kits are sold through large marketplaces or global brands.
        <strong>LivingDNA</strong> is a specialist provider that focuses heavily on
        <strong>fine-grained regional ancestry</strong> – especially for people with
        British, Irish or UK-linked roots – and increasingly also on wellbeing-focused
        DNA insights.
      </p>

      <div class="grid grid-2">
        <div class="card-ghost">
          <h3>When LivingDNA is a good fit</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>You care a lot about detailed UK &amp; European regional ancestry.</li>
            <li>You want a more granular breakdown of British or Irish heritage.</li>
            <li>You’re interested in wellbeing / lifestyle reports as an add-on.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="card-ghost">
          <h3>When a big marketplace kit is enough</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>You mainly want to find relatives and build a large family tree.</li>
            <li>You want a simple first DNA kit with frequent discounts.</li>
            <li>You’re okay with broader regions instead of ultra-detailed maps.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        A common approach is to start with a widely used ancestry kit, then consider LivingDNA
        as an additional test if you want deeper focus on specific regions – especially within
        the UK and nearby areas, or if you want combined ancestry + wellbeing in one kit.

    <!-- ACCURACY -->
    <section id="accuracy" class="card">
      <h2>How Accurate Are DNA Tests?</h2>
      <p>
        Accuracy depends on reference datasets, statistical models, database size and regional
        coverage. For well-sampled populations, accuracy is high. For smaller or under-sampled
        regions, results may be broader or updated over time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Relative matching (finding cousins, parents, siblings) is usually the most accurate
        aspect of DNA testing and works extremely well across providers.

      <h2>DNA Test Privacy &amp; Data Storage</h2>
      <p>
        Before taking a DNA test, consider how long companies store your DNA sample, how they
        handle deletion requests, and whether they partner with research organisations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Privacy policies differ widely. Some companies delete your sample after processing, while
        others store it for future updates unless you request otherwise.

    <!-- FAQ -->
    <section id="faq" class="card faq">
      <h2>Common Questions About DNA Tests</h2>

      <h3>Can DNA tests identify unknown family members?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. DNA databases grow quickly and make it possible to identify close and distant
        relatives even if they’ve never taken a test themselves.
      </p>

      <h3>Can DNA results conflict between companies?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes, because reference datasets and algorithms differ. Your ethnicity estimate may vary
        across providers, but close relative matches are typically consistent.
      </p>

      <h3>How long does processing take?</h3>
      <p>
        Usually 3–8 weeks after your sample reaches the lab. Peak seasons may take longer.
      </p>

      <h3>Is LivingDNA “better” than other kits?</h3>
      <p>
        It depends on your goal. For deep, UK-focused ancestry mapping, LivingDNA can be one of
        the strongest options. For huge family trees or US-focused cousin matching, larger
        databases like AncestryDNA or MyHeritage may still be more practical. Use
        <a href="https://genectics.com/?ref=testdna.bio-faq-livingdna" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
          Genectics.com</a> to see how they differ.

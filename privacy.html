      <h1>Privacy &amp; Cookies</h1>
      <p>
        TestDNA.bio is a small, static information site. We do not run user accounts, comment
        systems or contact forms, and we do not sell your personal data.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Who operates TestDNA.bio?</h2>
      <p>
        TestDNA.bio is operated by <strong>ronarn</strong> (Norway). The site focuses on neutral,
        evidence-based information about DNA testing and links to the independent comparison hub
        <a href="https://genectics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Genectics.com</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>2. What data is collected when you visit?</h2>
      <p>
        When you visit TestDNA.bio, basic technical information is processed automatically in order
        to deliver the site securely and reliably. This may include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>IP address and approximate region (used for security and abuse prevention).</li>
        <li>Browser type, operating system and device information.</li>
        <li>Pages visited and timestamps.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This type of data is standard for any website and is typically stored in web server or
        CDN (Content Delivery Network) logs for a limited time.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Hosting, CDN &amp; security</h2>
      <p>
        The site is hosted as static files and delivered through a content delivery network such as
        Cloudflare. These providers may process technical logs for the purpose of:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mitigating attacks and abuse (e.g. DDoS protection).</li>
        <li>Ensuring uptime and performance.</li>
        <li>Producing anonymous, aggregated traffic statistics.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We do not have access to personally identifying information beyond what is normally visible
        in anonymised or aggregated dashboards and logs.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Analytics</h2>
      <p>
        We may use privacy-conscious analytics tools or Google Analytics to understand overall usage
        of the site (for example, which pages are most visited and from which countries). This helps
        us improve content, but does not allow us to identify individual visitors in everyday use.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Google Analytics is enabled, IP anonymisation and standard data retention limits are used
        where available. You can use your browser’s privacy settings or ad/tracking blockers if you
        prefer not to be measured.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        TestDNA.bio does not set any cookies for log-in, comments or shopping carts. If analytics or
        security tools set cookies, these are used only to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Measure anonymous traffic patterns (e.g. page views).</li>
        <li>Protect the site from bots and abuse.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You can control or delete cookies at any time via your browser settings.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Links to Genectics.com and other sites</h2>
      <p>
        Many links on TestDNA.bio point to <strong>Genectics.com</strong> and other third-party
        websites. These external sites have their own privacy policies and may use cookies,
        analytics and affiliate tracking. Please read their policies if you want to understand exactly
        how your data is handled there.
      </p>
      <p>
        TestDNA.bio itself does not handle payments, orders or account details&mdash;those processes
        take place on third-party websites.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Your rights</h2>
      <p>
        If you believe information in server logs or analytics can be linked to you as an individual
        and you are located in a jurisdiction with data protection rights (for example the EU/EEA),
        you may have rights such as access, rectification or deletion. In practice, the data we can
        influence is highly limited and usually only available in aggregated form.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Changes to this notice</h2>
      <p>
        This privacy &amp; cookie notice may be updated from time to time if we change analytics,
        hosting providers or the way we link to third-party sites. The “last updated” date below will
        reflect the latest change.
